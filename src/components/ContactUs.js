        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          We are a young German team consisting of three developers who are
          studying coding and software engineering.

          During our exam, we have to face a challenge in developing, designing,
          and coding a functional app or website. In conjunction with the
          preference for tabletop games and the dissatisfaction with individual
          tools, we have tasked ourselves with the creation of our own
          application, the "Pen and Paper Dice Table", wherein one can virtually
          sit at a table and communicate with their dice in a straightforward
          and expeditious manner. You just make a table, and as the creator, you
          are also the GM. You can set the maximum number of players at the
          table, which dice can be used, and name the table. Players have the
          option to either be invited, search the table using the table ID, or
          join the table through the overview. In addition, the GM and players
          can make pre-sets so they don't have to choose every time for attacks
          or actions they use often. They can also use all the dice they need
          with a simple click. The dice can be rolled face down, visible only to
          the person rolling the dice and the GM, or they can be rolled openly
          for all to see.
