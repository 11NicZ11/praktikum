                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    We are a young German team consisting of three developers who are studying coding and software engineering.

                    During our exam, we have to face a challenge in developing, designing, and coding a functional app or website.
                    In conjunction with the preference for tabletop games and the dissatisfaction with individual tools, we have
                    tasked ourselves with the creation of our own application, the "Pen and Paper Dice Table", wherein one can virtually
                    sit at a table and communicate with their dice in a straightforward and expeditious manner. You just make a table,
                    and as the creator, you are also the GM. You can set the maximum number of players at the table, which dice can be
                    used, and name the table. Players have the option to either be invited, search the table using the table ID, or join
                    the table through the overview. In addition, the GM and players can make pre-sets so they don't have to choose every
                    time for attacks or actions they use often. They can also use all the dice they need with a simple click.
                    The dice can be rolled face down, visible only to the person rolling the dice and the GM, or they can be rolled openly for all to see.
